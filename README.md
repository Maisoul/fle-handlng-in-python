File Handling Assignment
Demonstrate your understanding of Python file handling by completing the following tasks.

Tasks:

File Creation:
Create a Python script (file_handling_assignment.py) that does the following:
Creates a new text file named "my_file.txt" in write mode ('w').
Write at least three lines of text to the file, including a mix of strings and numbers.


File Reading and Display:
Enhance your script to read the contents of "my_file.txt" and display them on the console.


File Appending:
Modify the script to open "my_file.txt" in append mode ('a').
Append three additional lines of text to the existing content.


Error Handling:
Implement error handling using try, except, and finally blocks to manage potential file-related exceptions (e.g., FileNotFoundError, PermissionError).


Explanation:
File Creation and Writing:

The script opens a new file named my_file.txt in write mode ('w').
It writes three lines of text to the file, mixing strings and numbers.
File Reading and Display:

The script reads the contents of my_file.txt and prints them to the console.
File Appending:

The script opens my_file.txt in append mode ('a') and adds three more lines to the existing content.
Error Handling:

The script uses try, except, and finally blocks to handle potential exceptions like FileNotFoundError and PermissionError.
The finally block ensures that a final message is printed, indicating the completion of file handling operations.
This script demonstrates basic file operations in Python, including creating, writing, reading, and appending to a file, along with proper error handling.
